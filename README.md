This project was made just out of boredom. A basic GUI tool that lets users lock or unlock files using fernet encryption.

### How to use

* Use the **"..."** button to browse for a file.
* Select either **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
* Click **Accept** to process the file.

## Important: the key is hardcoded directly into the program, so I'd only recommend it for trivial tasks (or better, don't use it at all xD).
